Modified version of Camera Patch Lite plugin by Freakler, which is based on DS3Remapper plugin by Total_Noob.

With the help of reprep, I've added a button combo check for movement (PSP_CTRL_MOVEBUTTON), due to fact that there are games that work better with it, such as SOCOM.

This plugin will add right analog stick support to the following PSP games on the Adrenaline eCFW:

Notes:
For Fireteam Bravo and Fireteam Bravo 2, you need to enter FREELOOK (camera mode) first by pressing Right D-Pad ingame.
For Fireteam Bravo 3, you need to enter FREELOOK (camera mode) first by pressing Up D-Pad ingame.

Camera (Right Analog) and movement (Left Analog) are not possible at the same time with this plugin. (To control the camera you need to stop moving and vice-versa).

This does not involve actual game patching but only shortcuts the already build-in camera controls of those games to the analog stick. Depending on the game this will work differently good or bad!


Installation:
Copy the prx file to your seplugins folder and add "ms0:seplugins/camera_patch_lite_alt.prx 1" to the game.txt file.
